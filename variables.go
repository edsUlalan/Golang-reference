// var keyword

var variablename type = value // You always have to specify either type or value (or both)

// := sign

variablename := value

// In this case, the type of the variable is inferred from the value
// (means that the compiler decides the type of the variable, based on the value)
// It is not possible to declare a variable using :=, without assigning a value to it
